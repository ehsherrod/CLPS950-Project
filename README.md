Our code performs a simple Visual Search Task in which participants need to identify whether there is a target shape (any non-circle shape) among a grid of distractor shapes (circles). There are three different target shapes used in this task, and three trials for each one. The order of the trials goes from easy to hard, allowing the participant to become acclimated to the task early on with the easiest to spot target shape.

The figure is presented to the participant to study for two seconds, after which they are prompted with a response page to press the space bar if they saw a target shape or do nothing if there was no target in the grid.

A score counter keeps track of whether the participant correctly responds to both target and non-target trials, displaying their final score in the final end screen.
